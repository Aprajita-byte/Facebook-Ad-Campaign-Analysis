# Facebook-Ad-Campaign-Analysis

The dataset, sourced from Kaggle's "Sales Conversion Optimization" by GOKAGGLERS, contains marketing and conversion data from a company's social media ad campaign. It comprises 1143 entries across 11 columns, detailing ad IDs, demographic information (age, gender, interest), ad impressions, clicks, expenditure, and conversion metrics. After identifying and removing 204 inconsistent records—where conversions were reported despite zero clicks—the cleaned dataset includes 939 valid entries. This cleaning ensures more accurate analysis and insights.

To deepen the analysis, key performance indicators (KPIs) were derived through feature engineering. These include CPM (Cost per Mille), which measures the cost per thousand ad impressions; CPC (Cost per Click), indicating the cost incurred per ad click; CTR (Click-Through Rate), reflecting the effectiveness of ads in generating clicks; and CPA (Cost per Acquisition), representing the cost to acquire a customer. These KPIs are essential for assessing ad performance and optimizing future campaigns.
